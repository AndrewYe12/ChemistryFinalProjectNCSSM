\subsection{Unit 1}
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
The molar mass of \(\ce{C_9H_8O_4}\) is \(1.008*8 + 12.01*9 + 16.00*4 = 180.2 \frac{g}{mol}\)
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    7.89kg \times \frac{1g}{10^{-3}kg} \times \frac{1mol}{180.2g} = 43.8mol
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
(b), the tallest peak of the graph is the one at \(64u\). 
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
In one mole of \(\ce{C_{13}H_{18}O_2}\) is \(206.31g\).
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    1mol\hspace{0.1em}\ce{C_{13}H_{18}O_2} \times \frac{13mol\hspace{0.1em}\ce{C}}{1mol\ce{C_{13}H_{18}O_2}} \times \frac{12.01g}{1mol\hspace{0.1em}\ce{C}} = 156.31g
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Thus, the percent composition by weight is \(\frac{156.31}{206.31} = 75.764\%\)
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
Take \(100g\) of the substance such that there are \(32.38g\) sodium, \(22.65g\) sulfur, and \(44.99g\) oxygen. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    32.38g\hspace{0.1em}\ce{Na} \times \frac{1mol\hspace{0.1em}\ce{Na}}{22.99g} &= 1.408mol\hspace{0.1em}\ce{Na} \\
    22.65\hspace{0.2em}g \ce{S} * \frac{1\hspace{0.2em}mol\ce{S}}{32.07g} &= 0.7063 \hspace{0.2em}mol\ce{S}\\
    44.99\hspace{0.2em}g\ce{O} * \frac{1\hspace{0.2em}mol\ce{O}}{16 g} &= 2.812\hspace{0.2em}mol \ce{O}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Take the ratio of each compound with the smallest quantity. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    S:\hspace{0.2em}\frac{0.7063}{0.7063} = 1 \\
    Na:\hspace{0.2em}\frac{1.408}{0.7063} = 2 \\
    O:\hspace{0.2em}\frac{2.812}{0.7063} = 4
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the empirical formula is \(Na_{2}SO_{4}\)

\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
\(\ce{Be}\). The peak location of the peak on the x-axis means that there is less binding energy for the electrons in element \(X\). \(\ce{Be}\) has fewer protons
and both electrons are in the same shell, so it peak must belong to \(\ce{Be}\).
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
\begin{itemize}
\item The electronegativity increases from left to right across a period. This is because if a valence shell of electrons is less than half full than
it requires less energy to lose an electron than gain one. If if the valence shell of electrons is more than half full, it is easier to pull and electron
into the valence shell. The electronegativity decreases from the top to the bottom of a group. This is beause there is a greater atomic radius lower on the group.

\item The ionization energy increases from left to right in a period. This is because of greater valence shell stability also because of smaller atomic radius. The ionization energy also decreases
from top to bottom of a group. This is because of greater electron shielding and greater atomic radius. 

\item Atomic radius decreases from left to right within a period. This is because there are more protons to the right of the period. Atomic radius increases from top to bottom within a group.
 This is because of electron shielding and there are more electron shells in the atom. 
\end{itemize}  
\subsection{Unit 2}
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
The ionic character increase the greater the electronegativity difference. In this case, \(\ce{Na}\) and \(\ce{O}\) had the greatest electronegativity difference.

(c) \(\chemfig{Cl-F} > \chemfig{H-I} > \chemfig{Se-N}\)
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
\ce{Cs+} has a larger atomic radius than \ce{K+}. So the distance between the cation and anion is greater than in \ce{CsF} than in \ce{KF}
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
Most metallic elements form crystalline solids at room temperature. Their bonds are metallic bonds due to electrostatic attraction between metal cations and delocalized electrons. 
\subsubsection*{Problem \countThis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Substitutional alloys. These alloys form when one atom of a similar size to the host metal replaces an atom of the host metal. The substitute atom must be of similar size. These alloys have good thermal and electrical conductivity.
    \item Interstitial alloys. These alloys are formed when smaller atoms fill in the gaps between the larger host atoms. This makes the metal harder and less malleable.

\subsection{Unit 3}
\AnswerSet
Dipole-diple and london dispersion forces. The \chemfig{C-O} bond is polar and the molecule is asymmetrical so it is polar. There are no \chemfig{H-F}, \chemfig{H-O}, or \chemfig{H-N} bonds, so there is no hydrogen bonding. 
\AnswerSet
Condensation. Both have no regular arrangement, the one on the left is separated by the one on the right is close together, so the molecules are transitioning from gas to liquid.
\AnswerSet
(a) As you increase the temperature, the average kinetic energy or speed increases as well. \\
(b) \(n_1 = n_2\) and \(V_1 = V_2\), so \(P_1V_1 = n_1RT_1\) and \(P_2V_2 = n_2RT_2\). \(\frac{P_2V_2}{RT_2} = \frac{P_1V_1}{RT_1} \implies P_2 = \frac{P_1T_2}{T_1} = \frac{0.7 * 425}{299} = 0.99atm\)\\
(c) As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy increases, so the molecules undergo more collisions with the walls of the container.  \\

\AnswerSet
Find the limiting reactant:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        36.0\hspace{0.2em}gH_{2}O * \frac{1\hspace{0.2em}molH_{2}O}{18.02\hspace{0.2em}gH_{2}O} *\frac{1\hspace{0.2em}molFe_{3}O_{4}}{4\hspace{0.2em}molH_{2}O} = 0.49945 \hspace{0.2em}mol Fe_{3}O_{4}\\
        67.0\hspace{0.2em}gFe * \frac{1\hspace{0.2em}molFe}{55.85\hspace{0.2em}gFe} * \frac{1\hspace{0.2em}mol Fe_{3}O_{4}}{3\hspace{0.2em}molFe} = 0.39988\hspace{0.2em}mol Fe_{3}O_{4}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the limiting reactant is \ce{Fe_{3}} \\
Find how much iron oxide is produced: Use the limiting reactant
\begin{equation}
    0.39988\hspace{0.2em}mol \ce{Fe_{3}} * \frac{231.55\hspace{0.2em}gFe_{3}O_{4}}{1\hspace{0.2em} mol\ce{Fe_{3}}} = 92.6 \hspace{0.2em}g Fe_{3}O_{4}
\end{equation}
Find how much excess reactant is left over:
\begin{equation}
    67.0\hspace{0.2em}gFe * \frac{1\hspace{0.2em}molFe}{55.85\hspace{0.2em}gFe} * \frac{4\hspace{0.2em}mol H_{2}O}{3\hspace{0.2em}molFe} * \frac{18.02\hspace{0.2em}gH_{2}O}{1\hspace{0.2em}molH_{2}O} = 28.8\hspace{0.2em}g H_{2}O
\end{equation}
28.8 grams of water is used out of 32.0 grams. So there is 7.2 grams left over of the excess reagent.

\ce{CH4} \hspace{0.5em} rate = \(\frac{-\Delta [\ce{CH4}]}{\Delta t}\) \\
\ce{O2} \hspace{0.5em} rate = \(\frac{-1}{2} \frac{\Delta [\ce{O2}]}{\Delta t}\) \\
\ce{CO2} \hspace{0.5em} rate = \(\frac{\Delta [\ce{CO2}]}{\Delta t}\) \\

\(10\frac{M}{s}\)
\AnswerSet
\(\frac{(0.04 - 0.1)M}{125ms} \times \frac{1ms}{10^{-3}s} = -0.48 \frac{M}{s}\)\\
rate = \(-\frac{1}{2} \times -0.48 = 0.24 \frac{M}{s}\)
\AnswerSet
When concentration of \(B\) is held constant and the concentration of \(A\) is tripled, the initial rate is multiplied by \(9\) so the order with respect to \(A\)
is \(2\). The order with respect to \(B\) is \(0\) because nothing changes when the concetration is increased. Thus the rate law is 
\begin{equation*}
    rate = k[A]^2[B]^0 = k[A]
\end{equation*}
\(1.0 \times 10^{-2} = k \times 0.1^2 \implies k = 1.0 \frac{1}{ms}\), thus \(rate = [A]^2\)
\AnswerSet
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
    ln[A]_t &= -kt + ln[A]_0 \\
    ln[A]_t &= -(4.8 \times 10^{-4})(825) + ln(0.0165)\\
    [A]_t = e^{-4.50} = 0.0111M 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Half-life:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        ln(\frac{1}{2}[A]_0) - ln[A]_0 &= -kt \\
        ln(\frac{1}{2}) &= -kt \\
        t &= \frac{ln(2)}{k}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
